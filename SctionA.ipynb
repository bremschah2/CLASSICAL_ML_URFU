    "A. Determine whether a website displays content for a mature audience: This problem involves predicting a binary outcome (whether the website displays content for a mature audience or not) based on certain features or attributes of the website. Supervised learning algorithms like binary classification models can be used to train on labeled data and predict whether a given website falls into the mature or non-mature category.\n",

    "B. Learn the best way to split a group of car buyers into categories based on their buying patterns: This problem involves clustering car buyers into different categories based on their buying patterns. While clustering is typically an unsupervised learning technique, in this case, if we have labeled data where car buyers are already categorized into different groups, then it becomes a supervised learning problem. Supervised learning algorithms like classification models can be used to learn the patterns and assign new car buyers to appropriate categories based on their features.\n",

    "C. Given the medical records from patients suffering a specific illness, learn whether we should split them into different groups for better treatment: This problem involves determining whether patients suffering from a specific illness should be split into different groups for better treatment. Supervised learning can be applied here by training a model on labeled data where patients are already categorized into different treatment groups based on their features and medical records. The model can then predict which group a new patient should be assigned to, based on their medical records and characteristics.\n",

Supervised learning techniques like regression can be used to train a model on the past decade's data, considering factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, farming practices, etc., and predict the crop yield for the next year.\n"
